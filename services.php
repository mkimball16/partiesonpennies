<h1>Our Services</h1>
<p>Parties On Pennies caters our planning to you and your event. No two events are the same, 
so neither is our approach. We offers custom decor for all our events. Our team of creative designers
    works with our clients to identify and execute innovative themes. We work with local
    companies to customize all aspects of our events, from colors and venue decorations 
    to custom favors and unique party games.</p>
    <p>Below is more information regarding the unique offerings for each type of event.</p>  
<div id="accordion">
  <h3>Engagements and Weddings</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Ah love. Such a beautiful thing. And the celebration of your love, whether that be 
    an intimate engagement party or a wild wedding for 200 guests, should be equally as 
    beautiful.</p>
    <p>Weddings is where Parties On Pennies got it's start. We love wedding 
    planning and we do it very well. Your wedding, and all the parties leading up to it,
    should be a reflection of you and your soon-to-be spouse. So whether that means pulling
    on some cowboy boots for a country-chic affair or slipping into something classy for a 
    black tie evening, we've got you covered.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>Anniversaries</h3>
  <div>
  <p>Congratulations! You aren't divorced! </p>
  <p>But seriously, it takes a lot of work to maintain a marriage these days. And it takes 
  even more work to maintain a marriage where you are both happy enough to celebrate years 
  after you said "I do". We are impressed and would be honored to help you plan an 
  incredible party for your lasting love. Whether that means vow renewals, a seated dinner
  for your guests, a backyard BBQ, or a night on the town, you can count on us to make
  your anniversary just as special as your wedding day.</p>
    </div>
  <h3>Birthdays</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Got a big birthday coming up? Want to throw your child the birthday bash of his or 
    her dreams? Need to pull a birthday party together but have no time or no idea where
    to start? Have no fear...Parties On Pennies is here.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
  </div>
    <h3>Bar and Bat Mitzvah</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Your son's or daughter's bar/bat mitzvah is an important milestone in a young 
    Jewish person's life. In recent years, these coming of age ceremonies have become 
    reasons for a big celebration with family and friends. Let Parties On Pennies plan 
    every aspect of this special day, from working with the synagogue to organize
    aspects of the ceremony, to helping you decide on a theme, to managing food and 
    entertainment - we do it all so you can spend your time making memories of this
    important day.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>Bar Crawls</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Did someone say copious amounts of beer? Count us in!</p>
    <p>Whether you want a themed bar crawl with custom apparel and souvenirs, or just 
    a carefully planned jaunt through the local bars of your city, Parties On Pennies
    will plan you a bar crawl to remember, although we can't promise you will. 
  </div>
  <h3>Non-Profit/Fundraising</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
    Giving back is something Parties On Pennies truly believes in. Not only have we been 
    involved in and donated to a variety of charities, but our President and CEO currently
    puts her web development and editorial skills to work for Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,
    a leading non-profit cancer care and treatment center in Boston, MA. Parties On Pennies
    has extensive experience in planning non-profit and fundraising events. Whether youâ€™re 
    looking to host an exclusive gala, a silent auction, or a large seated dinner, 
    Parties on Pennies will be your partner in planning an event that will raise awareness 
    (and funds) and increase donor participation.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>Corporate</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Believe it or not, most of the Parties on Pennies team currently works a 9-5 job 
    as well (we are very busy - keeps us out of trouble). And unfortunately, we have 
    attended our fare share of chaotic company outings, atrocious appreciation events, 
    and terrible team-building retreats. Don't let your next corporate event be a 
    snoozefest or fodder for water cooler gossip</p>
    <p>Parties On Pennies prides itself on planning corporate events that think outside 
    the box. No more trust falls or mundane lectures; we give your employees the event
    they need to keep them inspired and working hard for your organization. We perform a 
    full analysis of your employees: moral, wants, needs, etc. And we plan the event 
    (retreat, holiday party, conference, etc.) they were hoping for, but never thought 
    they would get.</p>
