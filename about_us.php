   Parties On Pennies was founded in 2014 after MacKenzie Kimball, President and CEO, took on
    all aspects of planning her sister's wedding. With a shoestring budget and a head full
    of cost-cutting and do-it-yourself ideas, Kimball got to work planning a party to 
    remember for her sister and soon-to-be hubby. Knee-deep in fabric swatches, vendor
    contracts, and appetizer choices, Kimball realized that she had fallen in love
    with the chaotic world of event planning. And it turns out, she had a real knack for 
    it -- no surprise since she hails from a long line of event planners.

    After receiving rave reviews for her wedding planning, Kimball decided to explore
    more event planning opportunities. Before she knew it, she was planning fundraisers, 
    birthday parties, and the occasional (but oh-so-enjoyable) bar crawl.
